You just put the word ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"s\u1ebd")," in so that you can describe that this thing is happening in the future. This also applies to all other situations, even ones where you would normally just change up the verb in English.

There is one special thing about ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"d\xe3 "),"that is different from your traditional English past tense though.

But, you use the word ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"d\xe3, "),"only if something happened before whatever you happened to be talking about. How does this work exactly? So lets say I\u2019m talking about what I was doing yesterday and I said that ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"strong"},"\u201cI cooked food\u201d")),".

The reason for this is because since we were talking about what was happening yesterday, I was presently cooking food yesterday. I didn\u2019t cook food at a moment before yesterday, so I don\u2019t need to use the word ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"d\xe3 "),"in that situation.

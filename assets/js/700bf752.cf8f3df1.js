You just put the word ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"s\u1ebd")," in so that you can describe that this thing is happening in the future.

There is one special thing about ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"d\xe3 "),"that is different from your traditional English past tense though.

But, you use the word ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"d\xe3, "),"only if something happened before whatever you happened to be talking about. How does this work exactly? So lets say I\u2019m talking about what I was doing yesterday and I said that ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"strong"},"\u201cI cooked food\u201d")),".

The reason for this is because since we were talking about what was happening yesterday, I was presently cooking food yesterday. I didn\u2019t cook food at a moment before yesterday, so I don\u2019t need to use the word ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"d\xe3 "),"in that situation.

Vietnamese on the other hand does not work like that. In order to say that one word belongs to another, we need to use ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"c\u1ee7a"),". Earlier, we learned that we need to put a preposition in front of the noun it is \u201cmodifying\u201d, but which one is that? Well luckily, we can see that the \u201c",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"strong"},"\u2018s")),"\u201d and the \u201c",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"strong"},"My")),"\u201d are the things being modified from are examples. So instead of having \u201c",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Sally"),"\u201d and \u201cI\u201d come first when using ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"c\u1ee7a, "),"we instead flip things around from normal.

If you don\u2019t though, here is an easy way of learning how it works. The word is used any time ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"b\u1eb1ng")," you are using one thing to do another thing. For instance,",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"strong"}," \u201cI went to the park using (a) bicycle\u201d"))," would translate to ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"\u201cT\xf4i \u0111i c\xf4ng vi\xean b\u1eb1ng xe \u0111\u1ea1p\u201d"),". In this case, the word a bicycle or \u201c",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"xe \u0111\u1ea1p"),"\u201d is being used to go to the park, so you would use ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"b\u1eb1ng"),". "),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"You could also translate this as ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"strong"},"\u201cI went to the park via bicycle\u201d")),", but while it works in this situation, it doesn\u2019t capture the full context of using ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"b\u1eb1ng")," so I would personally avoid thinking of it as ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"strong"},"\u201cvia\u201d")),". To show you what I\u2019m talking about, I could say the phrase ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"strong"},"\u201cAnh \u1ea5y \u0111ang n\xf3i b\u1eb1ng ti\u1ebfng Ph\xe1p\u201d, ")),"to say that someone is talking in French. But, you wouldn\u2019t say in English that \u201cHe is talking via French\u201d, you would say something more like ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"strong"},"\u201cHe is talking in French\u201d"))," or more specifically, ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"strong"},"\u201cHe is talking using French\u201d")),". The word ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"b\u1eb1ng "),"is also much more common in Vietnamese than it is in English. You will see many instances of ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"b\u1eb1ng")," being used in Vietnamese casually where the word ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"strong"},"\u201cusing\u201d ")),"or ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"strong"},"\u201cvia\u201d ")),"would be seen as formal or stiff in English.

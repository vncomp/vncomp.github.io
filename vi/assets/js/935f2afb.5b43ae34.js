Originally, it was written using a set of characters developed primarily in China which was a system known as ch\u1eef H\xe1n N\xf4m. Nowadays though, the Vietnamese language is instead written using an alphabet developed by Catholic missionaries starting in the 17th century which is known as ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"alphabet/compounds":{"id":"alphabet/compounds","title":"Compound Words (T\u1eeb Ph\u1ee9c)","description":"In Vietnamese, each syllable is represented by one block of letters. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that every word is made up of one syllable. That\u2019s where T\u1eeb Ph\u1ee9c, or \u201cCompound Words\u201d_** come into play. These words are formed using two letter blocks in order to make a single word. They come in many different varieties including, words where individual blocks are words by themselves, words where some blocks have meaning in older Vietnamese, but aren\u2019t really used on their own today, words where the same word is repeated twice for emphasis, a mixture of the first two ideas, and so on and so forth. Examples of these include words like \u201c**c\u1eeda s\u1ed5**\u201d (window), \u201c**im l\u1eb7ng**\u201d **_(to be silent), and \u201cth\u01b0\u1eddng th\u01b0\u1eddng\u201d _(often)_. But what does this mean for you? Mostly, this just results in making things harder for you to search up words because it can be hard to tell if a block is its own word or if it\'s part of a compound word. But with a little bit of trial and error and some reading practice, eventually, you should be able to figure out when you\u2019re looking at a compound or not.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"alphabet/consonants":{"id":"alphabet/consonants","title":"The Consonants","description":"Now that the vowels are covered we can begin moving onto the consonants. Now at first glance, they may seem easier to get a hold of than the vowels. The only thing that\u2019s different is a weird looking d. But the consonants can actually be more dangerous than the vowels. That\u2019s because some of them may seem like they would be pronounced the same way as in English, but are different.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"alphabet/letters":{"id":"alphabet/letters","title":"The Letters","description":"A a","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"alphabet/puttingwordstogether":{"id":"alphabet/puttingwordstogether","title":"Putting Words Together","description":"With the basic sounds out of the way, we can now begin combining our letters together. For starters, each standalone word in Vietnamese is a single syllable. So if you see a word like m\xec g\xf3i, you can safely assume that there are only 2 syllables because both of the pieces have a single syllable.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"alphabet/regionaldif":{"id":"alphabet/regionaldif","title":"Regional Differences","description":"In addition to all the things listed above, Vietnamese also has a number of regional dialects which fall neatly into 3 main categories: Northern (B\u1eafc), Southern (Nam), and Central (Trung). Each of these corresponds to a major city in Vietnam, being Ha N\u1ed9i, S\xe0i G\xf2n, and Hu\u1ebf respectively. There are also a number of sub-dialects that exist in between all of these categories, but their differences aren\u2019t as major.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"alphabet/specialcombos":{"id":"alphabet/specialcombos","title":"Special Combinations","description":"Outside of the letter combinations above, there is also a number of special combinations that exist between vowel sounds and finals which have the letters making slightly different sounds than they would normally. When you run into these combinations, their unique sound will always take priority when you\u2019re doing pronunciation. These also only occur either as standalone words or at the end of sentences.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"alphabet/vowels":{"id":"alphabet/vowels","title":"The Vowels","description":"In English, there are a total of 6 vowels, a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes y. But if you take a look at the chart, you\u2019ll notice that there are a few more copies of the vowels we all know and love. That\u2019s because in English, a vowel has more than one sound attached to it. For instance, yawn, ran, and car all use the letter a, but have a different vowel sound. That\u2019s not the case for Viet. Each of the above 12 vowels represents all of the potential standalone vowel sounds in the whole language which actually makes it easier to pronounce once you get the basics down!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/classifiers":{"id":"grammar/classifiers","title":"Classifiers vs \u201cThe\u201d and \u201cA\u201d (c\xe1i, con, and their friends)","description":"The words \u201cthe\u201d_** and **\u201ca\u201d** are a very important part of English grammar. However, you will notice that in Vietnamese, there is something that feels a bit off with their translations. You might often see the words **\u201cc\xe1i\u201d** and **\u201ccon\u201d** translated as either \u201cthe\u201d or **_\u201ca\u201d. How is it that these words can be translated both ways?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/describingthings":{"id":"grammar/describingthings","title":"Describing Things (l\xe0, th\xec)","description":"Speaking of adjectives, if I wanted to describe something using an adjective, one of the ways I could do this is by using the word \u201cis\u201d_**. For example, I might want to say that \u201cThe tree is tall\u201d to describe a tall tree. But in Vietnamese, translating the word \u201cis\u201d is a bit more complicated than it may seem at first. The Vietnamese word that translates directly to **_\u201cis\u201d in English is \u201cl\xe0\u201d_._ Sounds simple at first, right? All you need to do is sub in _\u201cis\u201d_ with \u201cl\xe0\u201d and you\u2019re done. But the thing about \u201cl\xe0\u201d is that it can only be used when describing one thing as another thing. Or in other words, describing one noun using another noun with some exceptions that we\u2019ll cover later down the line.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/grammar":{"id":"grammar/grammar","title":"Grammar (Ng\u1eef Ph\xe1p)","description":"Grammatically, English and Vietnamese are very similar in their structure to each other in a lot of ways. In many cases, the grammatical structures in Vietnamese function exactly the same as in English. But as shown from the alphabet, in Vietnamese, the details really matter. And just as there are many cases where Vietnamese and English work the same way, there are a number of small differences that really change the way certain words are used. So in this section, we will go over proper Vietnamese grammar and common words used in the language to help you better understand how the language works. It will also showcase, just like with the alphabet, how much Vietnamese people enjoy dropping things in order to make sentences easier and faster to say. Not everything here needs to be learned perfectly right away or should be learned perfectly right away, so take things one step at a time. If you ever feel like you\u2019re stuck, you can always come back here to find what you need.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/linkingconjunct":{"id":"grammar/linkingconjunct","title":"Linking Sentences Together Part 1: Conjunctions (v\xe0, nh\u01b0ng, m\xe0, ho\u1eb7c, hay, cho)","description":"Let\u2019s start with our basic conjunctions. A conjunction is used to link together two separate parts of a sentence. Take some sentences like \u201cthe cat and _**the dog\u201d, \u201cI would like to but, I don\u2019t have the time\u201d, or \u201cI have seen it **_although, I don\u2019t remember it well\u201d. You can see in all these examples, the bolded conjunctions are used to connect to separate ideas together. Luckily for us, the conjunctions in Vietnamese work exactly the same as in English.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/linkingintro":{"id":"grammar/linkingintro","title":"Linking Sentences Together: Introduction","description":"In order to build our sentences in English, we have a number of different words that we use that hold them together like \u201cand\u201d, \u201cwith\u201d, \u201cbut\u201d, and so on. These types of words also exist in Vietnamese but, unlike in English, Vietnamese has a big category for all of these different words. Everything that links sentences together into one category known as Quan H\u1ec7 T\u1eeb, or \u201crelational words\u201d. So how do we tackle this? Instead of going through every single one of these words in English, and translating them into Vietnamese here, instead we are going to go over a list of common words that really don\u2019t fit into any other categories. A lot of these words happen to also relate to things like time and location which are covered later so we can skip them for now. We\u2019re also going to separate them the same way we do in English just to make things easier on our self","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/linkingprepo":{"id":"grammar/linkingprepo","title":"Linking Sentences Together Part 2: Prepositions","description":"A preposition is a word that shows the relationship between a noun and some other thing. The preposition is always placed in front of the noun and is said to \u201cmodify it\u201d. For instance, if we take the prepositional phrases \u201cThe dog is with his owner\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m learning about it\u201d , we can see that the words with and about are being used to describe how the nouns, \u201chis owner\u201d and \u201cit\u201d, are related to the dog and the person learning. Once again, they function in Vietnamese the same way as they do in English.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/numbers":{"id":"grammar/numbers","title":"The Numerical System","description":"In this section we will cover how numbers work in Vietnamese and what we can do with them","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/position":{"id":"grammar/position","title":"Saying Where You Are","description":"In Vietnamese, the two words used for stating where something is are \u1edf and b\xean","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/sentenceorder":{"id":"grammar/sentenceorder","title":"Sentence Order","description":"As discussed in the intro, English and Vietnamese have a very similar grammatical structure on a basic level.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/tenses":{"id":"grammar/tenses","title":"How to Say When Things Happen","description":"In English, in order to say when an action is happening, we do this by changing its tense. If I were to go on a run and that run happened in the past, I might say I ran _**and if I am currently on that run, I would say I am running_. Vietnamese works slightly differently from this, for two different reasons.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Introduction","description":"Vietnamese is a very difficult language to learn. The way in which Vietnamese is spoken and written can be hard to wrap your head around, especially if you don\u2019t have much exposure to the language. But there\u2019s also a completely different layer of difficulty to learning Vietnamese; finding good resources on it.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);

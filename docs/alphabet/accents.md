# Accents (Dấu)

In Vietnamese, in addition to the extended alphabet, we have a series of different markings called _dấu_, or accents/tone marks which determine how we say a word.

It is important to keep these accents in mind because if you were to try and say a word in Vietnamese and use a different tone, it is more than likely that you are just going to end up saying the completely wrong word. This is also true when trying to write down a word you have heard in Vietnamese that you don’t know how to spell. Think of words whose spelling are separated by an accent in the same way as you would think of words with slightly different spelling. You wouldn’t look at **_bar_** and **_bear_** as the same word, so apply the same logic to words like **ma** and **má**.

A point that has to be brought up with these accents is the similarity between **ngã_ _**and **hỏi**. These 2 accents are so similar that Southern Vietnamese have effectively given up on trying to pronounce them distinctly and have resorted to pronouncing them the same. But if you want to try and learn how to distinguish them, **ngã_ _**is spoken at a higher pitch in comparison to **hỏi_. _**What helps me out when trying to pronounce these 2 is that **ngã_ _**sounds slightly more like asking a question when you are surprised, while **hỏi_ _**sounds more like asking a question when you’re thinking about something and want to confirm it with somebody.

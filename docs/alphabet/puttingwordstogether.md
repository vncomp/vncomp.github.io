# Putting Words Together

With the basic sounds out of the way, we can now begin combining our letters together. For starters, each standalone word in Vietnamese is a single syllable. So if you see a word like _mì gói, _you can safely assume that there are only 2 syllables because both of the pieces have a single syllable. 

To go along with this, Vietnamese is also a phonetic language. That means when you see certain combinations of letters in Vietnamese, they will always sound the same. For example, in English we can have a word like **_“lead”_** which has two pronunciations of the last three letters **_“ead”_**. In Vietnamese, on the other hand, there would only exist one way to pronounce that combination of 3 letters that would be used every time, if this combo of letters was possible in Vietnamese. For example, an actual sound that's possible to make in Vietnamese is the letters **ong. **Whether it be in the word, or these three letters combined will always make the same sound.

A Vietnamese word is made up of a potential of 3 parts. A vowel or vowel combination in the middle which is required, and an optional initial consonant and/or final consonant sound.

Initial (Optional) + Vowel Sound + Final (Optional)

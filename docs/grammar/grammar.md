# Grammar (Ngữ Pháp)

Grammatically, English and Vietnamese are very similar in their structure to each other in a lot of ways. In many cases, the grammatical structures in Vietnamese function exactly the same as in English. But as shown from the alphabet, in Vietnamese, the details really matter. And just as there are many cases where Vietnamese and English work the same way, there are a number of small differences that really change the way certain words are used. So in this section, we will go over proper Vietnamese grammar and common words used in the language to help you better understand how the language works. It will also showcase, just like with the alphabet, how much Vietnamese people enjoy dropping things in order to make sentences easier and faster to say. Not everything here needs to be learned perfectly right away or should be learned perfectly right away, so take things one step at a time. If you ever feel like you’re stuck, you can always come back here to find what you need.

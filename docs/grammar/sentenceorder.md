# Sentence Order 

As discussed in the intro, English and Vietnamese have a very similar grammatical structure on a basic level.

Similar to English, Vietnamese follows a _Subject-Verb-Object_ sentence structure. Now what does that mean in English? Let’s break down an example:


    _“He opened the door.”_


    Subject = He


    Verb = opened


    Object = the door

**Vietnamese: Anh ấy mở cái cửa**

**_English: He opened the door_**

**Anh ấy_ = He _**

**mở_ = open_**

**cái cửa_ = the door_**

As you can see, the general sentence structure between both languages didn’t change at all. 

One thing that is different though, is how adjectives work; the words used to describe things in a language. Let’s take a look at our example again, but this time, let’s say that instead of opening just a door, let’s see him open up a red door.

**Vietnamese: Anh Phúc mở cái cửa đỏ. **

**_English: Phúc opened the red door._**

**đỏ_ = red _**

You will notice that instead of the word for red (_đỏ) _is behind the word for door (_cửa_) instead of in front of it. That’s because in Vietnamese, when you use an adjective to describe something, you always put it behind the thing you are describing. With that out of the way, you now have a basic idea of how to make a sentence in Vietnamese.

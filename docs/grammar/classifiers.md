# Classifiers vs “The” and “A” (cái, con, and their friends)

The words **_“the”_** and **“a”** are a very important part of English grammar. However, you will notice that in Vietnamese, there is something that feels a bit off with their translations. You might often see the words **“cái”** and **“con”** translated as either **_“the”_** or **_“a”._** How is it that these words can be translated both ways?

The words **_“cái”_** and **_“con”_**, as well as many others in Vietnamese, are known as classifiers. In the same way **“the”** and **“a”** are used to call out a single object like “the tree” (**_cái cây_**) and “a dog” (**_con chó_**), the classifiers do so as well. Where they differ is that while we have the word “the” to say a singular thing is unique and the word “a” to say a singular thing is one of many, the classifiers don’t have that same distinction because whether or not something is unique or one of many doesn’t matter to the language. So really, the classifiers can refer to either **“the”** or **“a“**, it just depends on the context. 

In Vietnamese, there are 2 common classifiers:

**Cái:** used for objects that are inanimate or don’t move. Also used if you are unsure of which classifier to use

Examples:

**Cái điện thoại_ - a phone_**

**Cái xe đạp_  - the bicycle_**

**Con:_ _**used for objects that are animate or can move

Examples:

**_Con mèo - _a cat**

**_Con sông - _the river**

Using these 2 classifiers, we have covered pretty much most cases for the translation of the word **“the”** and **“a”** in Vietnamese. However, while these are the most common, there exists many, many more uncommon classifiers in Vietnamese that are used for much more specific things. Some of these are used frequently and others basically see no use at all. If you don’t know which one to use though, **_cái_** is always a safe bet.

Now for reference, here are some of the common classifiers besides **_cái_** and **_con_** that you will likely see while reading things in Vietnamese.

The word **_cái _**also has another purpose in addition to the one we just talked about. The word **_cái _**is also used to put focus on classifiers besides itself. So for example instead of just saying something like **_“quả táo”, _**you can instead say **_“cái quả táo” _**to place more emphasis on it.

Finally, we once again move on to casual speech, which just like before with **_là_** and **_thì_**, will have native speakers drop the classifiers altogether to make things easier to say and because you can figure out what they mean regardless. Again, I have to emphasize that you should definitely use the classifiers if you are learning or doing official business or writing, but natives will swap in and out between using these words and not using them when talking to each other in a lot of cases.

In addition, a lot of the time, native speakers will begin to pronounce **_cái _**with a sound similar to cớ or cí. This is, once again, to make pronunciation easier and has caused a lot of confusion for people trying to learn the language. But once you know this, it's pretty easy to figure out that the short c word in the front of something is just a lazily pronounced **_cái _**most of the time.


Speaking of adjectives, if I wanted to describe something using an adjective, one of the ways I could do this is by using the word **_“is”_**. For example, I might want to say that “The tree is tall” to describe a tall tree. But in Vietnamese, translating the word**_ “is” _**is a bit more complicated than it may seem at first. The Vietnamese word that translates directly to **_“is” _**in English is **“là”_._** Sounds simple at first, right? All you need to do is sub in **_“is”_** with **“là”** and you’re done. But the thing about **“là”** is that it can only be used when describing one thing as another thing. Or in other words, describing one noun using another noun with some exceptions that we’ll cover later down the line.

To show you this, below is a **_correct_** Vietnamese sentence using **“là”**:

**Vietnamese: Chị Hoa là bác sĩ.**

**_English: Hoa is (a) doctor._**

And now for an **_incorrect_** Vietnamese sentence using **là**:

**Vietnamese: Công viên đó là đẹp.**

**_English: That park is beautiful._**

**công viên_ = Park_**

**đó_ = That_**

**đẹp_ = Beautiful_**

While when translated, this makes perfect sense in English, it would not be correct to do in Vietnamese. Rather than using **“là” **in this scenario, the proper way to word this sentence is by switching out **“là”_ _**with the word **“thì”**. This word is normally translated as **_“then”_** in English, but in this case it can be translated to the word **_“is”_** for anytime you want to describe something with an adjective/descriptive word.

For example:

**Vietnamese: Công viên đó thì đẹp.**

But before we move on to the next section, let’s end with a bit of an advanced topic: Casual Speech. As a disclaimer, if you're just starting out, don’t worry too much about this part and just stick to using the proper grammar found above. Once you’re comfortable with that, then you can begin using the more casual way of talking.

A lot of times, in casual speech, native speakers will drop the words **là** and **thì** altogether. Partially because it makes things easier to say and partially because context clues fill in the gaps so it becomes unnecessary.

For example:

**Vietnamese: Công viên đó đẹp_._**

The meaning remains the same, but without the pesky extra words. Of course, this doesn’t apply to formal speech or writing, but it could be helpful to know when you’re speaking to someone outside of business hours. Be on the lookout for these things because we will be seeing a lot more examples as we move along.

As discussed in the intro, English and Vietnamese have a very similar grammatical structure on a basic level.

Similar to English, Vietnamese follows a _Subject-Verb-Object_ sentence structure. Now what does that mean in English? Let’s break down an example:


    _“He opened the door.”_


    Subject = He


    Verb = opened


    Object = the door

**Vietnamese: Anh ấy mở cái cửa**

**_English: He opened the door_**

**Anh ấy_ = He _**

**mở_ = open_**

**cái cửa_ = the door_**

As you can see, the general sentence structure between both languages didn’t change at all. 

One thing that is different though, is how adjectives work; the words used to describe things in a language. Let’s take a look at our example again, but this time, let’s say that instead of opening just a door, let’s see him open up a red door.

**Vietnamese: Anh Phúc mở cái cửa đỏ. **

**_English: Phúc opened the red door._**

**đỏ_ = red _**

You will notice that instead of the word for red (_đỏ) _is behind the word for door (_cửa_) instead of in front of it. That’s because in Vietnamese, when you use an adjective to describe something, you always put it behind the thing you are describing. With that out of the way, you now have a basic idea of how to make a sentence in Vietnamese.

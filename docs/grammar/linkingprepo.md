# Linking Sentences Together Part 2: Prepositions

A preposition is a word that shows the relationship between a noun and some other thing. The preposition is always placed in front of the noun and is said to “modify it”. For instance, if we take the prepositional phrases “The dog is **with** his owner” and “I’m learning **about** it” , we can see that the words **with **and **about **are being used to describe how the nouns, “his owner” and “it”, are related to the dog and the person learning. Once again, they function in Vietnamese the same way as they do in English.

Example Sentences:

**Vietnamese: Con chó đang chơi với con chim. **

**_English: The dog is playing with the bird._**

**Vietnamese: Con coi ti vi ở trong phòng**

**_English: I watch tv (at) inside (the) room._**

_Sidenote* The above sentence has a more in-depth explanation in the vocabulary section: Positioning Yourself _

Here is a list of some of the common prepositions. Some of them are going to get a deeper explanation underneath the table.

Now you may notice that the last 3 words don’t exactly have the cleanest definitions. That’s because we really don’t have a good English equivalent to either of them. So naturally, we need to go a bit deeper to explain why exactly these words work the way that they do.

**Possession (của)**

To begin with, we have the word **của**. Normally, in English, if we need to say that something belongs to another thing, we can just add “**_‘s_**” to the end or use a different word that indicates that. We can see this in simple phrases like “**_Sally’s sandwiches_**” or “**_My phone_**”. Vietnamese on the other hand does not work like that. In order to say that one word belongs to another, we need to use **của**. Earlier, we learned that we need to put a preposition in front of the noun it is “modifying”, but which one is that? Well luckily, we can see that the “**_‘s_**” and the “**_My_**” are the things being modified from are examples. So instead of having “**Sally**” and “I” come first when using **của, **we instead flip things around from normal. So “**_Sally’s sandwiches_**” becomes “bành mi của Sally” and “**_My phone_**” becomes “Điện thoại của tôi”. It also might be helpful if you remember the direct translation **_“of”_** like **_“Sandwiches of Sally”_** or **_“Phone of I”_**. 

Example Sentence:

**Vietnamese: Tôi đang ở nhà của Ông bà**

**_English: I am at my grandparent’s house_**

**Vietnamese: Đồ ăn của chị**

**_English: Her food_**

**By Means Of / By Using / Via (bằng)**

Now moving on to the word **bằng**, this word doesn’t really have a good translation into English. If you know any Japanese, this word acts exactly like the particle で except in front of the thing being modified. I just saved you a few minutes to a couple of hours. If you don’t though, here is an easy way of learning how it works. The word is used any time **bằng** you are using one thing to do another thing. For instance,**_ “I went to the park using (a) bicycle”_** would translate to **“Tôi đi công viên bằng xe đạp”**. In this case, the word a bicycle or “**xe đạp**” is being used to go to the park, so you would use **bằng**. 

You could also translate this as **_“I went to the park via bicycle”_**, but while it works in this situation, it doesn’t capture the full context of using **bằng** so I would personally avoid thinking of it as **_“via”_**. To show you what I’m talking about, I could say the phrase **_“Anh ấy đang nói bằng tiếng Pháp”, _**to say that someone is talking in French. But, you wouldn’t say in English that “He is talking via French”, you would say something more like **_“He is talking in French”_** or more specifically, **_“He is talking using French”_**. The word **bằng **is also much more common in Vietnamese than it is in English. You will see many instances of **bằng** being used in Vietnamese casually where the word **_“using” _**or **_“via” _**would be seen as formal or stiff in English. So in summary, you have something’s doing one thing using another thing, then use **bằng**.

Example Sentences:

**Vietnamese: Má muốn đi bên Ca Li bằng máy bay**

**_English: Mom wants to go over to California using a plane_**

**Vietnamese: Cậu đang ăn cơm bằng đũa**

**_English: He is eating rice using chopsticks_**

**To / In Order To (để)**

Continuing with concepts that don’t translate well into English, we have the word **để**. Unfortunately for my Japanese speakers, you don’t have an easy out this time. This word is used to describe that you are doing one thing in order to do another thing. For example, the sentence **_“I use a car to go to work”_**, can be translated as something like **“Anh sài xe để đi làm”** where the person uses a car **_to_** go to work. In English, this concept is mostly covered by the word **_“to”_**, but I’m making the distinction because the word **_“to” _**covers way more cases than the word **để**. For instance, you wouldn’t use **để **if you were going **_to _**somewhere. This word is also a fairly common word similar, to how **bằng **is pretty common. Now, we can move on to some examples.

Example Sentences:

**Vietnamese: Ông phải đeo kính để đọc sách.**

**_English: Grandpa has to wear glasses (in order) to read._**

**Vietnamese: Ba nấu thịt nướng để ăn.**

**_English: Dad cooked grilled pork (in order) to eat._**
